# Digit Recognition

This program allows user to draw numbers (0-9) using mouse dragment.
Based on the user input, this program recognizes the number.
For recongnizing, this uses two model - linear predict and convolutional model.
And in this program I implements factory design pattern.
All calsses encapsulated and I used interface for prediction.
Also I included class diagram of this program.


### Prerequisites 

change model path: 

1. python/convolutional-model/saved-models/model.py line8

2. python/linear-model/saved-models/model.py line 11

3. src/main/java/digit/predict/FXMLStartController lin38,41

### test result
in testResult folder

### class diagram
